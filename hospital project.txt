Do flu outbreaks or staff strikes cause more damage to our hospital's operational stability?

Are we sacrificing patient satisfaction by overloading our available beds?

💰 Financial Impact & Revenue
Which service generates the worst patient experience despite high resource investment?

How much revenue are we losing from patient refusals during peak demand periods?

Where should we invest in additional beds to capture the most missed patient revenue?

Are we keeping patients too long without improving their satisfaction?

Which service delivers the most consistently excellent patient experience?

Are we failing specific age groups with poor medical care quality?

Does keeping ICU patients longer lead to better outcomes or just higher costs?

📊 Strategic Planning
When should we hire temporary staff to handle predictable patient surges?

Which departments need immediate hiring to stop turning away patients?

How should we reallocate beds from underutilized services to overwhelmed ones?

Where can we reduce staff without impacting patient care quality?

⚠️ Risk & Compliance
Which services are at risk of complete staff burnout and collapse?

Are we prepared for the next flu season, or will our systems collapse again?
















Which hospital service is failing patients most often?
Hint: Compare patients_refused to patients_request across services and find weekly patterns

Where are we turning away patients while beds sit empty?
Hint: Look for services where available_beds > 0 but patients_refused > 0 in the same week

When did patient satisfaction collapse by more than 20%?
*Hint: Calculate week-over-week percentage change in patient_satisfaction and filter for drops >20%*

Do flu outbreaks or staff strikes cause more damage?
Hint: Compare average staff_morale and patient_satisfaction during flu vs strike events

Are we sacrificing patient satisfaction by overloading beds?
Hint: Check correlation between available_beds/patients_admitted ratio and patient_satisfaction

💰 Financial Impact & Revenue
Which service generates worst patient experience despite high resources?
Hint: Find services with high available_beds but low patient_satisfaction

How much revenue are we losing from patient refusals?
Hint: Estimate revenue loss by analyzing patients_refused during high-demand weeks

Where should we invest in additional beds?
Hint: Identify services with consistently high patients_refused despite good satisfaction scores

Which services deliver best satisfaction per bed?
Hint: Calculate patient_satisfaction per available_bed ratio across services

👥 Staffing Crisis & Workforce
Which departments have dangerously low staff-to-patient ratios?
Hint: Combine staff_schedule present counts with patients_admitted weekly

Are doctors, nurses, or assistants letting us down?
Hint: Analyze present rates by role across all services

Where do we have staff showing up but not enough patients?
Hint: Find services with high present staff but low patients_admitted

🏥 Patient Care Quality
Are we keeping patients too long without improving satisfaction?
Hint: Compare departure_date - arrival_date with satisfaction scores

Which service delivers most consistent patient experience?
Hint: Calculate standard deviation of patient_satisfaction across weeks for each service

Are we failing specific age groups?
Hint: Group patients by age ranges and compare average satisfaction scores

Does keeping ICU patients longer lead to better outcomes?
Hint: Analyze ICU patient stay duration vs satisfaction specifically

⚠️ Risk & Compliance
Which services are at risk of staff burnout?
Hint: Identify services with declining staff_morale and high patients_admitted

When did we violate care standards?
Hint: Find weeks where patients_refused > 50% of patients_request

Which departments need emergency intervention?
Hint: Flag services with multiple red flags: low morale, high refusals, poor satisfaction

Are we prepared for next flu season?
Hint: Analyze historical flu event impacts on all operational metrics
